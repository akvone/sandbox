# Why this project does exist? 
The main purpose of the `sandbox` project is to give a starting point with an existing code base
to play with different frameworks, libraries, and technologies.

# Modules structure
Generally, every module sticks to a rule: `one feature - one folder`. 

For example there is a `spring-boot/src/main/resources/config/properties` folder
which contains properties for code inside `spring-boot/src/main/kotlin/com/akvone/properties` package
